              We're a team of young entrepreneurs with a new take on an old
              idea. We saw the power of modern natural language processing and
              saw it could help people learn more effectively and efficiently.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              At Eofis, we recognize that we live in a knowledge economy. The
              human brain is only as powerful as the information it has
              available. We believe that the right approach and technological
              assistance can trigger the next great leap in human understanding.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              We build our software in constant communication with our clients
              and are deeply grateful for all the support and feedback we
              receive.
