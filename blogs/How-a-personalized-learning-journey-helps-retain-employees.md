# How a personalized learning journey helps retain employees

A great way to retain employees is by helping them achieve their learning goals\. This can be achieved through a personalized learning journey tailored to each employee based on their strengths, weaknesses and aspirations\.

In the past, employee training was often designed by management to fulfill the company's needs rather than those of employees, with little or no thought to how well the training would translate to a person's day\-to\-day job\. This resulted in many employees feeling like their needs were not being met by their employers\-\-and leaving as a result\.

Companies that value their workers have better reputations and higher retention rates than those who don't\. One in eight workers are looking for new jobs, a change in roles or a new employer\.

## To make sure each person gets the support they need to be successful, companies can build a personal learning journey \(PLJ\) for every employee\.

A PLJ is a fully individual learning experience that connects business\-critical knowledge with an employee's own experience\. It helps employees learn what they need to do their job well and how to apply that knowledge in their life outside of work\.

Whether you're looking for ways to improve retention or just stay competitive in today's market, building PLJs can help your organization achieve its goals by providing opportunities for staff members at all levels of experience\-\-from entry\-level employees up through seasoned veterans\-\-to gain relevant skills quickly and efficiently so they can hit the ground running when it comes time for them to contribute more fully toward overall company goals

## The process of personal leadership development at scale starts with data\.

A PLJ goes beyond traditional training programs by using data to learn about individuals' interests, strengths and challenges \-\- then aligning content with those factors\. A PLJ can be shaped around an employee's commitments and schedule, wherever whenever\. The result is a personalized learning experience that helps retain your talent by providing opportunities for growth within the organization\.

It also helps establish connections between workers and their managers, so each one gets the support they need from each other\.

This allows employees to see why the company needs them to do what they do\. It also helps managers understand their employees' needs, so that they can better support them in reaching their goals\. And since everyone learns differently, personalized learning journeys can help both parties connect the company's needs with each individual's intrinsic motivations\-\-which means that everyone will be more motivated as a result\! This is especially true when it comes down to understanding strengths and weaknesses: knowing how your strengths interact with those of others makes you more aware of potential problems before they arise; meanwhile knowing where other people excel will help you identify opportunities for collaboration \(and maybe even some friendly competition\!\)\.

## Employees who aren't engaged at work have more than twice as many days off due to illness or injury than engaged workers\.

A survey of 1,000 U\.S\. adults conducted by Gallup showed that employees who aren't engaged at work have more than twice as many days off due to illness or injury than engaged workers\. The study also found that engaged employees are less likely to call in sick, take extended medical leave and quit their jobs\-\-and they're more productive while they're there\.

In addition to helping reduce absenteeism, turnover and presenteeism \(working while sick\), personalization helps companies retain talent by making them feel like an individual rather than just another employee on a spreadsheet somewhere\.

## Organizations can use PLJs to automatically identify opportunities for improvement based on real\-time reviews, which can help increase engagement among staff members\.

The PLJ can also be used to identify opportunities for improvement based on performance reviews\. This can help increase engagement among staff members, as well as provide them with the tools they need to succeed in their roles\.

When you're looking at how a personalized learning journey can benefit your organization, remember that it's not just about improving one particular person's skillset; it's about improving the entire team\.

## Personalized learning journeys help companies retain talented employees by providing them with relevant experiences tailored to their needs and interests

PThe best employees are curious and self\-motivated\. Rather than suppress the curiosity, feed it\!

PLJ's are not just a new way to train employees, they are a way to create an ongoing dialogue between the employee and the company\.

Personalized, relevant learning journeys help us build a better relationship with our employees\.

## Relevant Real Retention

In short, a PLJ can help companies retain employees by providing them with relevant experiences tailored to their needs and interests\. This is especially important for organizations that want to keep their most talented workers engaged in their work and feeling like they're making an impact\.
