# Eofis \- today and tomorrow

We are eofis\. We like to simplify things and achieve goals fast\.

We are not impatient\. We believe time is valuable, there are so many things in our lives that we can do, want to do and need to do, that 24 hours often doesn't seem enough\. **We give you time back** by taking care of your learning experience\.

Eofis is an application for both desktop and mobile that was created to give you ownership over your time\.

“What do you mean, ‘give me ownership over my time’?”

Finally, you can prioritise and manage your daily time and duties by letting us do what help you out\. Let us clarify: we can’t do the laundry for you, or bring the dog for a walk\. But, we are pretty good when it comes to speeding up your learning experience\. How?

- Eofis creates quizzes for you from any text you are reading, and you want to remember long\-term\.

- Eofis also schedules the quiz practices for you, so you don’t need to worry about forgetting when and for how long to review your quizzes\.

- Lastly, eofis organises all the quizzes in a visual concept map for you, so you never lose or forget what you are learning\.

With eofis you have at least 2 more hours a day to take care of yourself, or meet friends and family, or just sleep\. How? Because now, you don’t need to spend time taking notes to prepare for an exam, or reading through long documents over and over again, or creating hundreds of flashcards \- or re\-writing the one you lost\. We will do that for you :\) \(You are welcome\)\.

## Vision

To go back to what eofis is, we wanted to tell you a little bit more about our vision\.

Right now, as I write this, we have working automatic quiz generation and the algorithm that presents you quizzes at time intervals\. In the coming months, we will create that super cool concept map we mentioned earlier\. Next, individual and group practices, gamification with reward system for each practice completed, group chat to follow up with your peers on the progress you’re making \(and how ready you feel for the Accounting exam you need to do\!\)\. Also, we like to keep things visual, so we’ll have a heat map that shows you the achievements you have reached until a certain point, and how close you are to meeting your goals?\!

After all of that, well, can we say that Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) is going to join your learning experience?

What if we told you that we aim to create an **AI\-powered software that gives you recommendations** about new topics you can learn to enhance your learning outcomes? What if I told you that the AI will also show you the existing topics in your concept map that are already related, and suggest **mixed practices** to reinforce your existing knowledge?

_Gosh…if we only had eofis during college, how easier would it have been to prepare for exams?_

That’s what we also thought when we started working on eofis \(in college, by the way\)\. But that's another story we’ll add to this “Founder’s Journal”\.

To recap, this is what we have **today**: Automatic quiz generation, Interval learning technology, Automatic tagging of topics\.

This is what we’ll have \(ideally\) **tomorrow**: visual concept map, individual and group practices, reward system, learning progress tracking, AI recommendations for new learning practices…

Is that the eofis app?

Nope\! Not yet\!

When we get some nice funding, and expand our team, we want to bring eofis to your house \(not literally, don't worry\)\. We’d love to connect eofis to Google home, so you don’t even need to check your phone to practice your daily quizzes\!

You: _Hey Google, open the eofis app, and let’s practice\!_

Google: _Opening eofis and starting your daily practice\._

\(Well, this is what we think you’d ask Google, feel free to rephrase the sentence differently haha\)\.

Why not practise also while you’re driving to work, or taking the bus, or walking your commute? We’ll enable eofis on multiple devices you use regularly, to facilitate your daily practice, to remove the hassle of opening your phone or laptop\. Instead, imagine using eofis on your AR glasses with voice commands, or practising questions using the volume buttons on your wireless headset\.

We plan to use the latest handwriting recognition, as writing by hand engages more of the mind than writing using a keyboard\. If you are one of those people who like to take notes by hand on paper or those cool laptops or notepads, we plan to allow you to highlight your notes and get eofis to automatically generate quizzes from these, and work its magic\.

So basically this is us\. **This is eofis\.**

Wow\. This was a long first article\. So, thank you for reading\! If you got to this point, you can finally take a breather, and thank us for finishing the article\. We did take some of your time to get you to this point of the article\. We promise you that you’ll get time back with our app, though\.

We aim to get all those cool tools in your hands, ears and eyes, pretty soon\! Just let us close an investment round, and you’ll be using eofis before even forgetting the content of this article\.

Till next time\. Enjoy your day\!
